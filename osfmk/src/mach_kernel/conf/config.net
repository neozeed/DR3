# This file enables the build of the in-kernel version of the 
# machine-independent network subsystem (based on the x-kernel
# from University of Arizona). Once this subsystem is set up, 
# it can be used by DIPC (add the DIPC_XKERN option to your 
# configuration file) and/or FLIPC (FLIPC option) and/or 
# user-space clients through the MACH device interface (default).
#
# The organization of the protocol graph is defined in 
# 	src/mach_kernel/uk_xkern/gen/graph.comp
#
# The use of remote GDB for kernel debugging is highly recommended.
# (in your configuration file, include "AT386/config.kgdb" rather 
# than "AT386/config.debug").
