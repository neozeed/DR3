# Up until version 2.7.2 of gcc there is
# a bug in the strength reducing code which
# doesn't spot overflows. In particular, the
# code in ppc_init for seg reg init does an
# infinite loop. Fixed in template.mk

# We assume that we won't hit this bug elsewhere as we should
# be using a more recent compiler (eg 2.7.2.1)
