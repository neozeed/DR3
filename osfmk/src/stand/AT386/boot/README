The boot sources are organized as follow:

src/stand/AT386/boot/primary:
	
	Contains sources to build the primary bootstrap.
	The resulting program must be copied to block 0 of the hard
	disk or a floppy.
	See corresponding README file.

src/stand/AT386/boot/secondary:

	Contains sources for the secondary bootstrap with networking
	capabilities. The network is just another device
	which can be accessed as a disk (note however that rewinding
	the file encompasses aborting the transfer and restarting it
	from the beginning, so be warned when writing loaders).

	The resulting program must be installed on the file system.
	See corresponding README file.

		
src/stand/AT386/boot/{include,lib}:

	Contains shared code between primary and secondary boot.

src/stand/AT386/boot/lilo:

	Contains sources to build the mklilo program.
	mklilo allows to build an image of the secondary boot
	loadable by LILO. LILO is the linux boot.


The secondary bootstrap is compiled with the libsa_fs library.
