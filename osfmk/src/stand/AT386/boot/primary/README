The boot built in this directory is intented to be installed
as a primary boot on a disk or floppy (first 8K). 

This boot understands MACH/BSD/OSF1 and LINUX file systems and
will only load ELF binaries.

It loads a single program. The default is /stand/mach_boot, the secondary
boot dedicated to mach. See README in the src/stand/AT386/boot/secondary
directory.

The target files are boot and rboot. The second form permits
the use of COM1 as the console. 

To install a boot on a disk, type
dd if=[r]boot of=<device> bs=1k conv=sync

When building boot and rboot, check that their sizes are
smaller than 8K to prevent overwriting the floppy file system.
