The mklilo program is used to build images that LILO (the linux boot)
is capable of loading.

The syntax is:

 mklilo <boot sector> <setup program> <kernel image> > <output_file>

In the Mach case, the kernel image is the secondary bootstrap:
obj/at386/stand/AT386/boot/secondary/mach_boot.lilo

The original bootsect and setup files from linux should be used.

The /etc/lilo.conf file must be edited with a new image description:

image = /mach_boot
  root = /dev/hda0 
  label = mach_boot
  append = "serial"

The root and append option lines are optional.
The append = "serial" enables the mach_boot remote console
