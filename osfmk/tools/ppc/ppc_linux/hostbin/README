INSTRUCTIONS FOR BUILDING UNDER LINUX

NOTE :  none of the commands here have been tested by actual use, they
	were written alongside a test-build, but not cut-and-pasted,
	so only trust them 95% for correctness.

To build these tools:

install as much of the mach_kernel include files as possible
from the mach_kernel directory:

  build MAKEFILE_PASS=FIRST

this will either complete successfully (if mig was already installed),
or will terminate when it can't find migcom. If it terminates because
of the lack of migcom, then
	cp mach/*.h ../../export/powermac/usr/include/mach/


Now build migcom and config, they can be found in:

src/mach_services/lib/migcom and src/mach_services/cmds/config

Install them by hand in tools/powermac/hostbin:

cp obj/powermac/mach_services/cmds/config/config tools/powermac/hostbin
cp obj/powermac/mach_services/lib/migcom/migcom  tools/powermac/hostbin

It is recommended that you then delete everything under
export/powermac and obj/powermac and start your building of the kernel
by re-exporting the include files.

Please update this file if there are any inexactitudes :)
